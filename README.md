# BMI-calculator
This project presents a comprehensive BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system is designed to assess the health status of both children and adults by computing their BMI based on key user inputs: age, gender, height (in feet and inches), and weight (in kilograms).
The application classifies users into standard BMI categories—Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese—and provides detailed, category-specific feedback. This includes likely health risks, recommended dietary practices, foods to avoid, and appropriate physical exercises tailored to each BMI classification. By integrating both assessment and guidance, the tool serves as a user-centric platform for promoting health awareness and proactive lifestyle choices.
The user interface is implemented as a single-page web application, with smooth navigation between logically structured sections: Welcome, About Me, BMI Calculator, Result, and Thank You. The dynamic functionality is powered by JavaScript, enabling real-time calculations and responsive content display. The site offers a clean, accessible experience suitable for users across different age groups, making it an effective tool for self-monitoring and educational purposes.
